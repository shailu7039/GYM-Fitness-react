                Trained here for 2nd year in a row. The location is great, not
                on the main road like most other gyms in the area so you donâ€™t
                get bothered by traffic. Surrounded by nature and mountain views
                makes for a pleasant training environment. Especially for the
                running. The gym also has a quite large boot camp area which I
                enjoyed training on. The coaches I found to be very professional
                and knowledgeable. Learned plenty of new stuff. Will definitely
                go back.
